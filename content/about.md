# About

I first discovered the world of web creation at the age of 11 when I began experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This early exposure ignited my passion for programming—an art where creativity meets technical problem-solving. As I delved further, I explored languages like Python and C#, using free online resources and tutorials to build small games and projects on my own. Even while managing my school commitments, I spent my spare time mastering these technologies, fueled by curiosity and self-motivation.

Recognizing my enthusiasm, my parents invested in an online course focused on modern web development. Although I initially followed the structured lessons, I soon realized that the abundance of freely available online content empowered me to continue learning independently. This journey instilled in me a deep appreciation for self-directed learning, especially in an era when technological advancements—such as breakthroughs in AI, autonomous vehicles, and robotic-assisted healthcare—are reshaping our world. It became clear that innovative problem-solving in computer science holds the key to making nearly anything possible.

My academic path led me to study Computer Engineering at Kadir Has University in Istanbul, aligning perfectly with my practical experiences and passion for technology. Throughout my journey, I have collaborated on a variety of projects. For instance, I worked with “57Colleges,” where I contributed to both front-end and back-end development for educational platforms, ensuring scalability and robust security. I spearheaded the design of user-friendly interfaces using WordPress, ASP.NET Core, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also partnering with medical clients to develop secure, HIPAA-compliant web applications—an experience that sharpened my ability to translate non-technical feedback into effective code solutions.

In parallel, I have built a solid foundation in programming languages and frameworks, including JavaScript, Vue, Firebase, Python, and C#. I have applied these skills to core computer science concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming. My independent projects include a personal portfolio website <a target="new" href="https://aligu.me"><u>(aligu.me)</u></a>, a full-stack social networking application complete with authentication and CRUD functionalities ([<u>Post App</u>](/projects/postapp)), and a platform for sharing meaningful quotes ([<u>sozler.im</u>](/projects/sozlerim)), among other tools and mini-games showcased on my <a target="new" href="https://github.com/aligu7"><u>Github</u></a>.

Looking ahead, I am eager to specialize in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural networks. I plan to deepen my understanding of deep learning, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented generation techniques. My goal is to merge cutting-edge theory with practical solutions that drive real-world impact, continually evolving as a developer who bridges innovative concepts with tangible outcomes.
